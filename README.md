Project Description:
Class project for Florida Polytechnic University course: Web Application Development (COP 3834) during the Fall 2023 semester.

This project focused on full-stack development of a basic website from scratch via LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack through Amazon Web Services, with the main focus of the project being to have the most optimal Search Engine Optimization and rankings. 

The theme of the project was to create a marketing/storefront website for a fictional product. In this case, Spray-On Shoes.
SEO was tested against other groups in the class via web search through a browser, with our website ranking #3 in search results.

The website was written primarily in HTML and CSS, built on a foundation of JavaScript bootstrap.  
The main IDE tools used included Adobe Dreamweaver and VS Code. 
All changes to the source code were made through Git, being saved and recorded on this GitHub repository. 

The website is no longer live, but all files that existed on the webserver for the duration of the class are visible here in this repository, and can be viewed locally via downloading the 'SourceCode.zip' folder.
