Gone is the inconvenience of having to find your shoes, having to remember which foot each shoe goes on, or having to remember how to tie your shoes. Now with these new spray on shoes from SneakSpray, I just grab the can, spray them on, and that’s it. So convenient! I used to hate having to choose a style of shoe to wear, and now I don’t have to! I recommend these new spray on shoes to any one who wants to do away with old inconvenient shoes and move to the new standard of convenient shoes. Thanks SneakSpray!"
